# 📘 Python Tuple (Theory Only)

## ✅ What is a Tuple?

A **tuple** is a type of data in Python used to store **multiple items** in **one variable**.

---

## 🔹 Important Points

- Tuples are **ordered**  
  → Items are stored in a fixed order.

- Tuples are **unchangeable (immutable)**  
  → You **cannot add, remove, or change** items after creating a tuple.

- Tuples **allow duplicate values**  
  → You can store the same value more than once.

- Tuples use **round brackets** `()`  
  → Example: `(1, 2, 3)`

---

## 💡 Why Use a Tuple?

- When your data should **not change**
- Tuples are **faster** than lists
- Tuples use **less memory**
- Useful for **fixed data** (like coordinates, colors, etc.)

## 🔑 Tuple vs List (Quick Difference)

| Feature | Tuple | List |
|--------|-------|------|
| Brackets | `()` | `[]` |
| Changeable | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Use Case | Fixed data | Changeable data |

## 🧠 Real-Life Examples

- Student information: `("Alice", 20, "B.Sc")`
- Location coordinates: `(19.07, 72.87)`
- RGB color code: `(255, 255, 0)`
