# 📘 Python Conditional Statements

Python conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

---

## ✅ if Statement

- The simplest decision-making statement.
- Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

---

## ✅ if...else Statement

- Adds an alternate block of code if the condition is false.
- Used when there are two possible outcomes.

---

## ✅ if...elif...else Statement

- Allows checking multiple conditions.
- Executes the first block where the condition is true.
- If none are true, the `else` block runs.

---

## ✅ Nested if Statement

- Using an `if` statement inside another `if` block.
- Useful for checking multiple levels of conditions.

---

## 🧪 Logical Operators

- Used to combine multiple conditions:
  - `and`: All conditions must be true
  - `or`: At least one condition must be true
  - `not`: Reverses the result of a condition

## ⚖️ Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning                        |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                       |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                   |
| `>`      | Greater than                   |
| `<`      | Less than                      |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to       |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to          |

## 🔁 Use Case Examples

- Check if a user is eligible to vote
- Compare numbers and perform actions
- Validate inputs like age, login, score
- Control program flow based on options

## 🎯 Summary

Conditional statements are a core part of decision-making in Python. They let your programs react to user input, data, and other logic to make dynamic, intelligent choices.
