# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

# 'hello' is the same as "hello".

print("Hi")
print('Hello')

# You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

a = """I am Priyanka Desale, currantly I am study in diploma third year, of IT Department."""
print(a)


# Or three single quotes:

a = '''I am Priyanka Desale, currantly I am study in diploma third year, of IT Department.'''
print(a)
