<!-- Explain the difference between block/inline in a comment -->
<!-- 
    Block vs Inline Elements:

    Block elements:
    - Always start on a new line.
    - Take up the full width available (by default).
    - Can contain other block or inline elements.
    - Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <section>, <article>

    Inline elements:
    - Do NOT start on a new line.
    - Only take up as much width as necessary.
    - Typically used to style small parts of content inside block elements.
    - Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>
